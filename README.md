## Technical Details
The KanyeWest-Ye-API repository is a light-hearted project that generates random quotes attributed to Kanye West. It‚Äôs built primarily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with humorous or notable quotes from Kanye at the press of a button. This project is designed to deliver fun interactions using simple front-end technologies.
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
  The KanyeWest-Ye-API repository is built with the following components:

HTML: Provides the structure for the webpage.

CSS: Styles the page for visual presentation.

JavaScript: Handles fetching random quotes from an API that generates Kanye West quotes.


This combination creates a simple, interactive application that pulls and displays quotes on demand



### Implementation
For Software:
For a software implementation of the KanyeWest-Ye-API:

1. Frontend: Use HTML for structure and CSS for styling. JavaScript will handle the interactivity.


2. JavaScript Functionality:

Create a button event listener.

On click, use fetch() to call the Kanye West quote API endpoint.

Retrieve the JSON response and extract the quote text.



3. Display: Dynamically update the HTML to show the new quote each time the button is pressed.

Project Overview

The Funny Random Quote Generator is designed to make you laugh, snicker, giggle, and occasionally roll your eyes.

The universe (or at least our algorithm) delivers a little nugget of humor straight to your screen.
